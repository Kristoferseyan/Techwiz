# Techwiz
TechWiz is a mobile app that helps users troubleshoot common computer and laptop issues. Built with a Flutter frontend and a Spring Boot backend, it features secure login and clean architecture. The app now includes a lightweight AI assistant powered by a locally hosted language model (via Ollama), which analyzes user-reported problems and suggests the most relevant fixes from a structured database. Still a work in progress, but itâ€™s steadily evolving into a real-world full-stack project.
